Book Away is a web-based frontend prototype for a train ticket booking platform. 

This project demonstrates the user interface design, layout structure, and navigation flow of a booking system. It allows users to visually navigate through the booking process, view schedules, and access customer support information. It is built using pure HTML and CSS to ensure a lightweight and responsive design.
